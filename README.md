- 👋 Hi, I’m @adaminthecape
- 👀 I’m interested in javascript and stuff. Every day that I learn more about javascript is a good day!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more every day about javascript, typescript, and life in general.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects which need a keen eye for validation and dependency management.
- 📫 Reach me at my gmail address, which is the same as my github name.
